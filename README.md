# Overview

‚ö° A JavaScript code quiz using the default browser's API

## Summary

üíª Users can play a JavaScript code quiz game that has a timer and the clock subtracts by 5 if answered incorrectly. High scores can be viewed as well, using local storage to store data.

‚ö†Ô∏è CSS Layout looks a bit rough currently, VS Code's built-in browser shows it completely different than what Edge's browser shows. I'll fix this after finished with the JavaScript stuff.
